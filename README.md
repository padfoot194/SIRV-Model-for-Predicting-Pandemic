# SIRV-Model-for-Predicting-Pandemic
Hi, I am Mushfiqul Amin, an undergraduate student of Electrical and Electronic Engineering at Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology.
This is my first project in undergraduate life which I did in my sophomore year of undergraduate. I along with my labmate did this project in the Numerical Analysis Laboratory which is a lab course of EEE. The project was done using MATLAB. We created a mathematical simulation model for predicting a pandemic in any region. We have created two systems. First by using raw data and second by setting up the parameters manually.
